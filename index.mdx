## How it works

Everything in Shepherdly updates in real-time. When a team member adds a prayer request, marks a task complete, or schedules an event, everyone sees it immediately.

Your **Dashboard** gives you a daily briefing of what needs attention:
- Sermons approaching their delivery date
- Tasks that are overdue or due soon
- Prayer requests waiting for your prayers
- Upcoming events and birthdays

## Who is it for?

Shepherdly is designed for:

- **Lead pastors** who need visibility across all ministry areas
- **Associate pastors** preparing sermons and caring for people
- **Church staff** coordinating events, tasks, and team communication
- **Ministry volunteers** who need access to specific workspaces
