## Sermon queue overview

The left column lists up to forty sermons filtered by status. Tabs at the top focus on <strong>All</strong>, <strong>In review</strong>, or <strong>Scheduled</strong> sermons. Selecting a sermon opens its outline, resources, and metadata on the right.

<Info>
Statuses include `draft`, `in_review`, `scheduled`, `delivered`, and `archived`. The Dashboard shows progress for every sermon that is not delivered.

## Create a sermon

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the dialog">
    Click <strong>New sermon</strong>. Only the title is required, but adding scripture and opening thoughts helps your team get traction quickly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft collaboratively">
    The sermon immediately appears at the top of the queue. Select it to open the outline container, then begin writing or paste AI-generated content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach supporting material">
    Use <strong>Attach reference</strong> to upload commentary notes, testimonies, or liturgy elements. Resources stay tethered to the sermon for later review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tip>

## Manage sermon status

- Update the status from the list item dropdown once peer review begins or when the outline is scheduled.
- Progress bars represent the underlying status: drafts show 20%, reviews 55%, scheduled sermons 75%, and delivered sermons 100%.
- The "Delivering in" label keeps you aware of upcoming preaching dates.

<Warning>
Delivered sermons still appear until archived. Archive them after uploading final recordings to keep the queue focused on active work.
</Warning>

## Resource section

Each sermon detail view contains a Resources panel:

- Upload text-based references (illustrations, testimonies, research) for the teaching team.
- See resource type, labels, and content inline without leaving ChurchDesk.
- Empty states remind you to capture supporting material before the sermon is finalized.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sermon not appearing in queue" icon="list">
    Verify you saved the creation dialog. The queue shows the 40 most recent entries—older sermons may be archived automatically by Convex jobs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Outline missing after refresh" icon="file-text">
    Ensure the content field was saved before navigating away. Keeping the sermon card open while edits sync prevents overwriting with stale data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need to change scheduled date" icon="calendar">
    Edit the sermon record in Convex or adjust the associated calendar event, then refresh the Sermons workspace to update the label.
