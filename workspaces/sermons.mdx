## Overview

The Sermons workspace is where you track all your sermons as they move through preparation. The list shows sermons filtered by status with search and pagination for larger libraries.

## Sermon statuses

Every sermon moves through a clear workflow:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Idea** | Initial concept, not yet started |
| **Outlining** | Building the structure |
| **Writing** | Developing the content |
| **Polishing** | Refining and finalizing |
| **Ready** | Complete and waiting for delivery |
| **Delivered** | Preached to your congregation |
| **Archived** | Stored for future reference |

The status shows as a progress bar so you can see at a glance how close each sermon is to completion.

## Creating a sermon

1. Click **New sermon**
2. Enter a title (required)
3. Optionally add:
   - Scripture references
   - Series name
   - Scheduled delivery date
4. Click **Create**

Your sermon starts in "Idea" status and appears at the top of the list.

## Filtering and search

- Use the **status tabs** to filter by stage (All, In Progress, Ready, Delivered)
- **Search** finds sermons by title
- Results are paginated — use navigation to browse older sermons

## Opening the Studio

Click any sermon to open it in the **Studio editor**. This is where you write the actual content with structured blocks for main points, scripture, illustrations, and more.

See the [Studio documentation](/workspaces/studio) for details on the editor.

## Sermon details

Each sermon tracks:
- **Title** and **scripture** references
- **Series** for grouping related messages
- **Scheduled date** when you'll deliver it
- **Status** showing preparation progress
- **Created/Updated** timestamps

<Tip>
Schedule your sermon's delivery date when you create it. The Dashboard will remind you as the date approaches.
