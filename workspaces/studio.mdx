## Overview

The Studio is Shepherdly's sermon writing environment. It provides a distraction-free space with custom block types designed specifically for sermon preparation.

## Editor layout

The Studio has three main areas:

- **Left panel** — Sermon details (title, scripture, series, status, delivery date)
- **Center** — The main writing area
- **Right panel** — AI Assistant for suggestions and help

Panels can be resized or collapsed to focus on what you need.

## Block types

The editor uses structured blocks instead of plain text. Each block type serves a specific purpose:

### Main Points
Your sermon's primary arguments or sections. These are automatically numbered (1, 2, 3...).

### Subpoints
Supporting points under each main point. These nest under their parent main point.

### Scripture
Bible passages with proper formatting. Add references that support your teaching.

### Illustrations
Stories, examples, and real-world applications that bring your points to life.

### Applications
Practical takeaways for your congregation. What should they do with this message?

## Writing tips

- Use **keyboard shortcuts** for faster formatting
- **Drag blocks** to reorder your outline
- The editor **auto-saves** as you type
- Point numbers update automatically when you reorder

## Version history

The Studio automatically creates snapshots as you work. You can:

- View previous versions of your sermon
- Pin important versions to keep them accessible
- Restore an earlier version if needed

Access version history from the menu in the details panel.

## Exporting

When your sermon is ready, export it for printing or sharing:

- **PDF** — Clean, formatted document ready to print
- **Word (DOCX)** — Editable document for further refinement

Exports include your main points, scripture references, and all content blocks formatted for readability.

<Tip>
Export to PDF right before you preach. It creates a clean document you can bring to the pulpit.

## AI Assistant

The right panel provides AI-powered assistance:

- Get suggestions for illustrations
- Find relevant scripture passages
- Refine your wording
- Generate application ideas

The assistant understands your sermon context and provides relevant suggestions.
