## Overview

The Dashboard is your starting point each day. It shows what needs attention across all your workspaces in one view.

## Your Focus

The top of the dashboard highlights your single most important item — whether that's an overdue task, an upcoming event, or a sermon approaching its delivery date. This helps you know exactly where to start.

## Key sections
