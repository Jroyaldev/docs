## Channel list

The left rail lists every channel sorted alphabetically. Each card displays the channel name, visibility (`open` or `private`), and an optional description. Channels created from the People workspace also show a "Pastoral care" badge.

<Info>
Open channels are visible to the entire workspace. Private channels are limited to invited teammates and leadership roles.
</Info>

## Join or create a channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an existing channel">
    Click a channel card to load its message history. The active channel is highlighted with a primary border.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a new channel">
    Press <strong>New channel</strong>, then set the name, description, and visibility. ChurchDesk accepts lowercase, hyphenated names by default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to pastoral records">
    From the People workspace, use "Open care channel" or "Open household channel" to auto-create and navigate to a contextual channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compose messages

- Draft messages in the composer at the bottom of the screen. ChurchDesk clears the draft after you send it.
- Use Shift+Enter to add line breaks.
- Mentions use the handles defined in the Team workspace (e.g., `@hannah.wilson`).

<Tip>
Keep the Chat workspace open during staff meetings. Messages stream live as other leaders post updates from their desks or phones.
</Tip>

## Empty state behavior

When a channel is brand new, the main pane prompts you to "Break the silence". Send the first update to confirm everything is working.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel disappeared" icon="slash">
    Private channels only show up for members with access. Ask a lead pastor to add you or confirm you are still on the team roster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Messages not sending" icon="send">
    Ensure your Convex deployment is running. The send button disables when the draft is empty, so add content before clicking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pastoral care badge missing" icon="stethoscope">
    Open the member or household record and recreate the channel using the quick action to ensure the correct context is applied.
