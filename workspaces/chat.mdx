## Overview

Chat provides real-time messaging for your ministry team. Organize conversations into channels by topic, ministry area, or project.

## Channels

Conversations happen in channels. Each channel has:

- A **name** describing its purpose
- **Visibility** — open (everyone) or private (invited members)
- **Members** who can participate

The sidebar lists all channels you have access to. Click a channel to view its messages.

## Channel types

- **Open channels** — Visible to everyone on your team
- **Private channels** — Only invited members can see and participate
- **Direct messages** — One-on-one conversations

## Creating a channel

1. Click **New channel**
2. Enter a channel name (lowercase, use hyphens for spaces)
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Choose visibility: Open or Private
5. Click **Create**

For private channels, invite specific team members after creation.

## Sending messages

Type your message in the composer at the bottom and press Enter to send.

- **Shift + Enter** — Add a line break without sending
- Messages appear instantly for everyone in the channel

## Real-time updates

Messages stream live as teammates send them. Keep Chat open during meetings or throughout the day to stay connected with your team.

<Tip>
Create channels for specific ministries or projects to keep conversations organized and searchable.

## Best practices

- Use **#general** for church-wide announcements
- Create **ministry-specific channels** (worship, youth, outreach)
- Use **private channels** for sensitive leadership discussions
- Keep channel names short and descriptive
