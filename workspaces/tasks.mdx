## Board layout

The Tasks workspace visualizes ministry work across five status columns: <strong>Backlog</strong>, <strong>Next up</strong>, <strong>In progress</strong>, <strong>Blocked</strong>, and <strong>Completed</strong>. Every card shows priority, due dates, tags, and followers at a glance.

<Info>
Card colors reflect status and priority so you can scan for urgent, blocked, or overdue items instantly.
</Info>

## Filter the board

Use the filter panel above the board to focus on the work that matters right now.

- **Search** filters tasks by title or description.
- **Owner** shows tasks assigned to a specific teammate or those still unassigned.
- **Priority** limits to low, medium, high, or urgent work.
- **Tag** filters by ministry area such as "worship" or "facilities".

<Tip>
Filters sync with URL parameters. Share filtered board links in chat so teammates view the exact same slice.
</Tip>

## Create a task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the dialog">
    Click <strong>New task</strong> and provide a descriptive title.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add details">
    Set an optional description, priority, and due date. ChurchDesk accepts future dates only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign later">
    Tasks can be created unassigned. Use the card controls to set an owner as soon as you know who is responsible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Work within a card

- Change assignee, status, and due date inline without closing the card.
- View or clear due dates using the calendar input and reset button.
- Toggle the comment feed to exchange updates or tag teammates (ChurchDesk supports mentions via the Team workspace handles).
- Followers count shows who is subscribed to updates.

<Warning>
Closing a card while a mutation is still pending can lead to temporary UI drift. Wait for the spinner to disappear before navigating away.
</Warning>

## Empty states and guidance

Each column displays contextual prompts when empty (e.g., "Capture future ministry ideas here" for the backlog). Use them to align your team on how to categorize work.

## Troubleshooting
