## Overview

The Tasks workspace helps you manage ministry work with clear priorities and deadlines. Tasks can be assigned, delegated, and tracked through completion.

## Views

Switch between different views to focus on what matters:

- **Overview** — All active tasks ranked by priority
- **Today** — Tasks due today
- **Upcoming** — Tasks with future due dates
- **Someday** — Tasks without a due date
- **Recurring** — Repeating tasks (coming soon)

## Creating tasks

1. Click the **+** button or use the quick add
2. Enter a task title
3. Set priority: Urgent, High, Medium, or Low
4. Add a due date (optional)
5. Assign to yourself or a team member

Tasks appear immediately in the appropriate view.

## Priority levels

Tasks are color-coded by priority:

| Priority | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Urgent** | Needs immediate attention |
| **High** | Important, complete soon |
| **Medium** | Standard priority |
| **Low** | Nice to have, no rush |

The Overview sorts tasks by priority first, then by due date.

## Delegation

Assign tasks to team members to delegate work. The assignee sees the task in their view, and you can track progress.

Your Dashboard shows a badge when you have delegated tasks — reminding you to follow up on work you've assigned to others.

## Completing tasks

Click the checkbox to mark a task complete. Completed tasks move out of active views but remain in your history.

<Tip>
Review your Today view first thing each morning to know exactly what needs to happen.

## Due dates

Tasks with due dates show:

- **Today** — Due today (highlighted)
- **Overdue** — Past due date (red warning)
- **Upcoming** — Future due date with date shown

Overdue tasks surface prominently on your Dashboard.
