## Understand the prayer wall

The Prayer workspace centralizes all requests submitted by your church and staff. Filters across the top let you view <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Church</strong>, <strong>Team</strong>, <strong>My requests</strong>, or <strong>Answered</strong> items. The list refreshes in real time as teammates post updates or close requests.

<Info>
Only Staff, Pastors, and Lead Pastors see the <strong>Team</strong> filter. Volunteers and members are automatically redirected to the Church feed.
</Info>

## Post a prayer request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the submission dialog">
    Click <strong>Share a need</strong> to launch the dialog. ChurchDesk remembers your last privacy selection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the story">
    Provide a short title, describe the situation, and choose who should see it (Church, Team, or Private).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit and notify">
    Press <strong>Post request</strong>. The card appears instantly in the feed and, when relevant, in the Dashboard prayer widget.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Team-only requests stay visible even when you temporarily switch the filter to Church, so staff can keep momentum without losing context.
</Tip>

## Manage privacy and status

- **Privacy badges** show who can see the request: Church, Team, or Only you.
- **Status badges** track progress: `open`, `answered`, or `archived`.
- Leaders or the original author can mark a request as answered. ChurchDesk records the completion date automatically.

<Warning>
If you cannot update a request, verify you are the author or have a Staff-or-higher role. The interface disables controls for unauthorized users.
</Warning>

## Encourage follow-through

Use the description field to include:

- Specific people to contact.
- Timelines for follow-ups.
- Scripture or pastoral notes for inspiration.

Answered requests gain an emerald banner with the resolution date. Share these wins in staff meetings to cultivate faith.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team filter is disabled" icon="lock">
    Upgrade the user to Staff or Pastor in the Team workspace so they can view internal requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prayer feed appears empty" icon="ban">
    Add a new request or switch the filter back to <strong>All</strong>. Empty states prompt you with next steps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot mark as answered" icon="check-circle">
    Ensure you are either the author or hold a leadership role. Otherwise ask a pastor to update the status.
