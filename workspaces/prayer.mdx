## Overview

The Prayer Wall is where your team shares prayer needs and celebrates answered prayers together. Requests update in real-time as people pray and add updates.

## Viewing prayers

Filter prayers by tab:

- **All** — Every prayer request
- **Church** — Public requests visible to everyone
- **Team** — Staff-only requests (leadership roles only)
- **My moments** — Requests you've submitted
- **Answered** — Prayers that have been answered

## Creating a prayer request

1. Click **Share a need**
2. Enter a title describing the request
3. Add details in the description
4. Choose privacy level:
   - **Public** — Visible to entire church
   - **Team** — Staff and pastors only
   - **Private** — Only you can see it
5. Click **Post**

Your request appears immediately in the feed.

## Praying for requests

Click the prayer button on any request to indicate you've prayed. The count shows how many people have prayed for that need.

## Marking prayers answered

When God answers a prayer:

1. Open the request
2. Click **Mark as answered**
3. The request moves to the "Answered" tab with a celebration banner

## Privacy
