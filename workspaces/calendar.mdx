## Two views in one

The Calendar workspace combines an upcoming schedule list with a monthly snapshot so you can glance at both the details and the big picture. Tabs separate church events from personal pastoral reminders.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upcoming schedule" icon="calendar-clock">
    A vertical timeline sorted chronologically with visibility badges and descriptions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monthly snapshot" icon="calendar-days">
    A grid that highlights each day with church events, personal follow-ups, and overflow indicators.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Personal follow-ups are visible only to the author. Use them to block pastoral visits or counseling sessions without exposing details to the entire team.
</Tip>

## Schedule an event

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the event dialog">
    Click <strong>Schedule event</strong>. ChurchDesk pre-fills start and end times one hour apart.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add event details">
    Provide the title, optional type, location, and notes. Choose visibility: <strong>Church</strong> for everyone, <strong>Staff</strong> for internal planning, or <strong>Personal</strong> to keep it private.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and confirm">
    Press <strong>Save event</strong>. The event appears immediately in the Upcoming schedule and the monthly snapshot with appropriate badges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Interpreting the timeline

- Date chips show the month abbreviation and day number.
- Time labels adjust based on whether the event spans a single day or multiple days.
- Visibility badges reveal if the event is church-wide, staff-only, or personal.
- Descriptions and locations help volunteers know where to report.

## Monthly snapshot cues

- Church events display as solid badges using the primary color.
- Personal follow-ups render as dashed-outline badges.
- Overflow counts (`+3 more`) appear when more than three items occupy the same day.

<Warning>
If the snapshot grid appears empty, confirm your Convex deployment is returning events within the current month.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event saved without time" icon="clock">
    Double-check your browser locale supports the <code>datetime-local</code> input. Re-enter the time or adjust the value manually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal events visible to others" icon="eye">
    Personal visibility keeps the event out of church and staff tabs, but leaders with higher roles can still audit for scheduling conflicts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeline order looks wrong" icon="list">
    The list sorts by start timestamp. Ensure every event has a start date and time before saving.
