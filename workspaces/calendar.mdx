## Overview

The Calendar shows all events for your church in a monthly view. Plan gatherings, track sermon delivery dates, and coordinate your team's schedule.

## Calendar view

The main view shows a month grid with:

- **Church events** — Visible to everyone
- **Team events** — Staff and leadership only
- **Personal events** — Only visible to you
- **Sermon dates** — When sermons are scheduled for delivery

Click any day to see its events or create a new one.

## Creating events

1. Click a day on the calendar, or click **New event**
2. Enter the event title
3. Set the date and time
4. Choose visibility:
   - **Church-wide** — Everyone sees it
   - **Team** — Staff only
   - **Personal** — Just you
5. Add location (optional)
6. Toggle **All-day** for events without specific times
7. Click **Save**

## Event types

Events can span multiple days. Multi-day events show across the calendar with visual indicators of their duration.

**All-day events** appear at the top of each day without specific times. Use these for:

- Holidays
- Conference days
- Retreats

## Integration with Dashboard

Your Dashboard's Calendar Rail shows the next 7 days of events. This gives you a quick preview without opening the full calendar.

Sermon delivery dates also appear on the calendar, pulled from your Sermons workspace.

<Tip>
Schedule sermon delivery dates when you create sermons. They'll automatically appear on your calendar.
