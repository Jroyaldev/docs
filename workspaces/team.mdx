## Leadership gate

The Team workspace is restricted to leadership roles. Non-leadership users encounter a notice explaining how to request access or promote themselves if no lead pastor exists yet.

<Warning>
Promoting yourself to Lead Pastor is only available when no other leader exists. Use this option responsibly to keep governance healthy.
</Warning>

## Profile completion card

Newly provisioned users may see a prompt to confirm name, email, and title. ChurchDesk syncs data from WorkOS, but you should:

- Replace placeholder names (`Pastor` or email handles) with full names.
- Update emails ending in `@unknown` with real addresses.
- Adjust the displayed ministry title to match your church context.

<Check>
Saving the profile immediately updates mentions, chat labels, and dashboard greetings.
</Check>

## Manage the roster

Cards summarize each teammate with:

- Avatar, name, primary title, and email.
- Activity metrics (tasks, follow-ups, mentions).
- Role selector and editable displayed title.
- Shortcuts to view tasks filtered by owner or open follow-up lists.

<Tip>
Role dropdowns disable on your own card. Ask another leader to adjust your permissions if needed.
</Tip>

## Role title presets

The "Set preferred ministry titles" card lets leadership:

- Define the primary title for each canonical role (Lead Pastor, Pastor, Staff, Volunteer, Member).
- Provide alternate titles (e.g., Student Pastor, Worship Director) for quick selection.
- Backfill existing teammates so their cards update automatically.

## Mentions directory

The mention directory provides a searchable list of handles and email addresses. Copy a handle to the clipboard to use in chat, tasks, or notes.

<Note>
Handles use the format generated from the teammate's name or email. Keep names accurate to maintain readable mentions.
</Note>

## Leadership activity

The workspace surfaces leadership state information from Convex. If new leadership slots are available, a banner invites eligible users to promote themselves to keep governance intact.
