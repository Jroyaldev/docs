## Overview

The Team workspace is where you manage who has access to your Shepherdly workspace and what they can do.

<Note>
Only leadership roles (Lead Pastor, Pastor, Staff) can access the Team workspace.
</Note>

## Roles

Every team member has a role that determines their permissions:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Lead Pastor** | Full access to everything, can manage team |
| **Pastor** | Full access to most features |
| **Staff** | Access to operations and people workspaces |
| **Volunteer** | Limited access, can create tasks and prayers |
| **Member** | Basic access to public content |

## Viewing your team

The Team page shows all members with:

- Name and profile photo
- Role and custom title
- Email address
- Activity summary

## Inviting members

1. Click **Invite member**
2. Choose the role for the new member
3. Copy the invite link

Share the link with your new team member. When they click it, they'll be able to join your workspace with the assigned role.

Invite links expire after use for security.

## Changing roles

Lead Pastors and Pastors can change team member roles:

1. Find the team member
2. Click their role
3. Select a new role from the dropdown

Role changes take effect immediately.

<Warning>
Be careful when assigning leadership roles. They have access to sensitive pastoral information in the People workspace.
</Warning>

## Custom titles

Beyond the standard roles, you can set custom titles that display throughout the app:

- "Youth Pastor" instead of just "Pastor"
- "Worship Director" instead of just "Staff"
- "Small Group Leader" instead of just "Volunteer"

This helps your team identify each other by their actual ministry role.

<Tip>
Set custom titles that match how your church actually refers to each position.
