## Access requirements

Only Lead Pastors, Pastors, and Staff can open the People workspace. Everyone else sees a restricted notice to keep pastoral care records private.

<Warning>
Invite new leaders with the correct role before sharing household data. Promotions propagate instantly across all workspaces.
</Warning>

## Directory view

The Directory tab lists every member with filters that focus the right group quickly.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    <h3>Filters</h3>
    <p>Choose from presets like <strong>Needs follow-up</strong>, <strong>New this month</strong>, <strong>Volunteers</strong>, <strong>Youth</strong>, and <strong>Staff</strong>. Filters combine status, tags, and creation dates.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>A case-insensitive search scans names, emails, and tags. As you type, ChurchDesk debounces the query to keep performance high.</p>
  </div>
</Columns>

Each member drawer reveals:

- Profile data, contact info, and tags.
- Household relationships with quick links to open the household record.
- Follow-up tasks tied to the person.
- Notes, attendance history, and timeline events to remember past touchpoints.
- A personal chat channel for staff collaboration.

<Tip>
Click "Open care channel" on a member or household to jump straight to their dedicated chat thread in the Chat workspace.
</Tip>

## Households view

Use the Households tab to organize families and shared addresses. The list supports filters for <strong>All households</strong>, <strong>New this month</strong>, and <strong>Needs follow-up</strong>.

Household details include:

- Member roster with roles (head, spouse, child, etc.) and segment flags for youth or caregivers.
- Communication preferences (email, SMS, mail) so you contact families the way they prefer.
- Shared notes, care history, and linked tasks from Convex.
- Quick actions to promote a primary contact or update the address.

## Manage staff invites

Lead Pastors and Pastors see the Invite Manager below the workspace:

- Generate single-use join links tied to specific roles.
- Download a QR code for in-person onboarding.
- Revoke or expire links instantly if one is shared accidentally.

<Note>
Invites inherit role titles from the Team workspace presets. Update those first so new leaders land with the right language.
</Note>

## Integrations across ChurchDesk

- Creating a follow-up task automatically surfaces on the Dashboard and Tasks board.
- Marking a prayer request for a household makes it appear in the Prayer workspace with the correct privacy channel.
- Chat channels created from the People workspace show up in the Chat workspace with member context applied.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Filters return no results" icon="filter">
    Ensure the tags or statuses exist on your member records. Add an inclusive filter like <strong>Everyone</strong> to confirm the list is populated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Household drawer will not open" icon="folder-open">
    Check your URL parameters. Remove `householdId` from the address bar to reset the state and reload the list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invite link fails after sending" icon="link">
    Links expire after first use or when the expiration timestamp lapses. Generate a fresh link from the Invite Manager and share securely.
