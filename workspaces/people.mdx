## Overview

The People workspace helps you care for your congregation by tracking members, organizing households, and recording pastoral interactions.

<Note>
This workspace is restricted to leadership roles (Lead Pastor, Pastor, Staff) to protect sensitive pastoral information.

## Directory

The main directory lists all members in your church. You can:

- **Search** by name
- **Sort** by recent activity, alphabetical, or last engaged
- **Filter** by follow-up status

Click any person to view their full profile with contact info, notes, and engagement history.

## Adding people

1. Click **Add person**
2. Enter their name and contact information
3. Add any initial notes
4. Optionally assign them to a household

## Households

Group family members together in households. This helps you:

- Track family units as a whole
- Share contact information
- Record household-level notes

Go to **People > Households** to manage household records. Each household can have multiple members with roles like "Head of household", "Spouse", or "Child".

## Groups

Organize people into ministry groups like:

- Small groups
- Volunteer teams
- Ministry departments

Groups have leaders and members. Use them to coordinate ministry activities and communication.

Go to **People > Groups** to create and manage groups.

## Classes

Track educational programs and their participants:

- New member classes
- Bible studies
- Training programs

Go to **People > Classes** to manage class enrollment.

## Pastoral care

For each person, you can:

- Add **notes** from conversations and visits
- Track **follow-ups** that need attention
- View their **engagement history**

These records help your pastoral team provide consistent, informed care.
