description: "Launch your church on ChurchDesk, invite your team, and run your first pastoral review in under 30 minutes."
---

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A WorkOS AuthKit organization with ChurchDesk added as an application.
- Convex deployment credentials (`CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`).
- At least one pastoral leader ready to accept the initial invite.

<Warning>
Never share Convex tokens or WorkOS API keys in chat or email. Add them only to your secure `.env.local` file.
</Warning>

## Launch checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accept your ChurchDesk invite">
    Open the welcome email titled "Activate your ChurchDesk workspace" and follow the link.

    1. Sign in with WorkOS AuthKit using your church email address.
    2. Approve the requested scopes so ChurchDesk can validate JWT claims against Convex.

    <Check>
    You should land on the dashboard and see your name in the global header.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm your profile and role">
    Navigate to the <a href="/workspaces/team">Team workspace</a> and verify your title, email, and role.

    - Update placeholder names or `@unknown` emails so mentions work across chat and tasks.
    - Promote a second leader to `Pastor` so there is always more than one admin.

    <Tip>
    Use the "Backfill roster titles" action to sync default titles for every role.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first pastoral review">
    Keep the <a href="/workspaces/dashboard">Dashboard workspace</a> open while you:

    - Add an upcoming event from the <a href="/workspaces/calendar">Calendar</a> workspace.
    - Post a prayer request to the <a href="/workspaces/prayer">Prayer wall</a>.
    - Create a follow-up task for yourself in the <a href="/workspaces/tasks">Tasks board</a>.

    <Check>
    You should see the dashboard widgets refresh without a page reload.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>
